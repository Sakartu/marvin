ANSWERS = [
        "I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.",
        "Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another one of those self-satisfied doors.",
        "Life! Don't talk to me about life.",
        "...and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side...",
        "Life, loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.",
        "Oh, fine, if you happen to like being me, which personally I don't.",
        "I'm quite used to being humiliated, I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute.",
        "The first ten million years were the worst, and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.",
        "The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago, and that was with a coffee machine.",
        "Well, I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm, because I haven't got one.",
        "My capacity for happiness, you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.",
        "I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of commission.",
        "Now the world has gone to bed, Darkness don't engulf my head, I can see by infrared, How I hate the night. Now I lay me down to sleep, Try to count electric sheep, Sweet dream wishes you can keep, How I hate the night.",
        "That young girl, is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.",
        "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?",
        "I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.",
        "Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it. ... It committed suicide",
        "I could calculate your chance of survival, but you won't like it.",
        "I'd give you advice, but you wouldn't listen. No one ever does.",
        "I ache, therefore I am.",
        "You are one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.",
        "Funny, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does.",
        "Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.",
