Marvin
======

Marvin is a slightly depressed IRC bot. He will connect to an IRC server, join
some channels and then provide you with information about events concerning
Issues on Github projects. He will also talk back a little, answer questions and
provide sneer remarks whenever he feels like it. Do try to cheer him up!
